&amp;ldquo;In line with Meta AIâ€™s commitment to open science, we are sharing Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT-175B), a language model with 175 billion parameters trained on publicly available data sets, to allow for more community engagement in understanding this foundational new technology.&amp;rdquo;

I&amp;rsquo;m curious what a visual programming environment for answer set programming might look like, and if it would help make teaching predicate logic (the calculus of computer science) easier.
Notes (reverse chronological):
New Name - VASP - Visual Answer Set Programming Cut bait. Blockly is so closely tied to the imperative and procedural programming paradigm that plugging in a declarative logic programming language generator side-by-side with an imperative language generators of Javascript, Dart, PHP, etc.</description></item><item><title>The Good Stuff</title><link>https://forkemdevs.github.io/posts/thegoodstuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://forkemdevs.github.io/posts/thegoodstuff/</guid><description>Years ago I told a friend who was involved in cancer research how inspiring his volunteer work was. He told me, sometimes we pick our causes, sometimes our causes pick us.
Starting this page to keep a list of causes I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Arizona State University computer science students being involved with since joining the program:
